# Mark Packham Portfolio

This site was created to demo my skills as a dev and should run on all modern browsers.
There is a portfolio page where various projects can be downloaded.
This README.MD is here to cover these various projects.

## Website's own tech

This site was mainly built with just HTML and CSS.
JS also used to update copyright date on webpage footers.
I also wanted to demo use of modal, gradients and flexbox.
